 Project Update: Coffee Orders Data Analysis Using Excel 

I recently completed a hands-on data analysis project involving a dataset of coffee orders. The goal was to extract key business insights and create an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel.

Here’s what I did:

Used XLOOKUP to pull in relevant values from multiple sheets into a consolidated main sheet

Standardized and cleaned the data for consistency and analysis

Created Pivot Tables to explore trends such as:

Total sales over time

Sales by country

Top 5 customers by revenue

Incorporated Slicers for easy filtering by:

Roast type

Loyalty card status

Coffee size

Integrated Timelines to analyze performance across months and years

Wrapped it all up with clear data visualizations to highlight insights and trends

This project sharpened my skills in Excel reporting, data modeling, and interactive dashboard creation—crucial tools for turning raw data into actionable insights.
